- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much about software development as possible
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java for Android, C# for Windows Forms Apps (with SQL Server), Python for Raspberry Pi projects (for fun and as part of my job). I have recently started learning C++ which is a skill I need for an upcoming project. Web-development (HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap) is a skill I want to acquire and am also learning JavaScript.
